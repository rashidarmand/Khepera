# Khepera ‚òÄÔ∏èüêûüí∏

## What is Khepera?

In it's current state, Khepera is a decentralized ethereum token exchange running on the Kovan test net that allows you to purchase & sell KHEP (ERC-20) tokens.

## Why did I build it?

I built Khepera as an MVP to show what I've been learning & test out the fundamentals of Solidity and ERC-20 tokens on the ethereum blockchain. I also built the project to understand more how programming for blockchain differs from regular web applications in general.

## Why the name Khepera?

The name has its origin in ancient egyptian mythology and means to *"develop"* or *"come into being"*. Khepera symbolizes the manifestation of the rising sun. Khepera is often depicted as a scarab beetle or a man with a scarab beetle for a head. Additional details can be found [here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khepri#:~:text=Khepri%20(Egyptian%3A%20%E1%B8%ABprj%2C%20also,and%20the%20renewal%20of%20life>).

## How to use Khepera

In order to use Khepera you just need a metamask account & some ethereum on the Kovan test network. Head [here](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet), sign up with Github, & send the public address for the account you want to receive ethereum on Kovan to get started.

## Tech Stack

- Solidity
- Next.js
- Chakra-UI
- Redux
- Mocha & Chai (For Testing Smart Contracts)

## MVP Features

- Ethereum Smart Contracts written In Solidity.
- Smart Contracts tested using Mocha & Chai.
- KHEP token implemented using ERC-20 standard.
- Ability to deposit, withdraw, & trade ETH for KHEP & vice-versa.
- Next.js frontend with Chakra-UI for styling & Redux for global state management.
- Exchange & KHEP token contracts are deployed live to the Kovan ethereum test net.

## Future Plans for Khepera

- More order types (Limit, Market, etc.)
- Support more ERC-20 tokens
- Enhance UI (Better Design)
- Light & Dark Mode
- Explore adding other application functionality (NFTs, De-Fi, etc.)
